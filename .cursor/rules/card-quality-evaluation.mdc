# Card Quality Evaluation Framework

## Overview

This framework defines how to evaluate existing cards and generate new ones. Each category has different goals, so the same question can be excellent for one category and terrible for another.

## Common Rules (All Categories)

### Required (Pass/Fail)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Grammar** | No spelling errors, proper punctuation, question marks where needed |
| **Clarity** | Meaning is unambiguous, easy to understand on first read |
| **Open-ended** | Invites discussion or action, not just yes/no answers |
| **Appropriate** | No hate speech, discrimination, or content that could cause harm |

### Universal Quality Metrics (1-5 scale)

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Uniqueness** | Not a cliché or overused question |
| **Engagement** | Will people actually want to answer/discuss this? |
| **Replayability** | Can this card be drawn multiple times without getting stale? |

## Category-Specific Evaluation

### Scoring Weights Matrix

Each category prioritizes different qualities. Score from 1-5, then multiply by weight.

## Difficulty Levels (Card Property)

Difficulty is a **property of each card**, not a scoring metric. It indicates the **intensity of the primary focus** for that category.

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Light intensity of primary focus |
| 2 | Medium intensity of primary focus |
| 3 | Maximum intensity of primary focus |

### What Difficulty Means Per Category

| Category | Difficulty 1 | Difficulty 3 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Dating** | Light connection questions | Deep compatibility/intimacy questions |
| **Deep Talk** | Gentle self-reflection | Raw vulnerability, life-changing moments |
| **Hot Topics** | Mild debate topics | Highly divisive moral dilemmas |
| **Buzzed** | Fun and silly | Maximum chaos and embarrassment |
| **Most Likely** | Safe playful guesses | Spicy roasts |
| **Never Have I Ever** | Common experiences | Shocking secrets |
| **Truth or Drink** | Easy confessions | Risky truths people might drink to avoid |
| **Would You Rather** | Fun hypotheticals | Impossible existential dilemmas |
| **Pick Your Poison** | Mildly bad options | Genuinely terrible choices |
| **Pictionary Adult** | Suggestive concepts | Explicitly adult themes |

### Usage

When generating cards, specify difficulty as a filter:
```
"Generate 10 difficulty 3 cards for Hot Topics"
→ Creates high moral complexity, divisive debate questions

"Generate 10 difficulty 1 cards for Dating"
→ Creates light, comfortable icebreaker connection questions
```

## AI Evaluation Instructions

When evaluating a card:

1. **Check Common Rules First** - Fail immediately if grammar/clarity issues
2. **Identify Category** - Apply category-specific weights
3. **Score Each Metric** - 1-5 scale
4. **Calculate Weighted Score** - Multiply by category weights
5. **Flag Issues** - Note specific problems and suggestions

### Evaluation Output Format

```json
{
  "card": "Original card text",
  "category": "category-id",
  "currentDifficulty": 1,
  "suggestedDifficulty": 2,
  "passesCommonRules": true/false,
  "issues": ["list of problems"],
  "scores": {
    "connection": 4,
    "vulnerability": 3,
    "moral": 1,
    "funEnergy": 2,
    "shock": 1,
    "uniqueness": 4,
    "engagement": 5
  },
  "weightedScore": 72,
  "recommendation": "keep" | "revise" | "remove",
  "suggestedRevision": "Improved version if needed"
}
```

Note: `suggestedDifficulty` helps identify if a card is labeled wrong (e.g., a deep question marked as difficulty 1).
```

## AI Generation Instructions

When generating new cards:

1. **Know the Category** - Understand primary and secondary focus
2. **Check Uniqueness** - Don't duplicate existing cards
3. **Match Difficulty** - Generate for specific difficulty level
4. **Apply Category Rules** - Use good/bad examples as guide
5. **Self-Evaluate** - Run through evaluation before outputting

### Generation Prompt Template

```
Generate [N] new cards for [CATEGORY] at difficulty [1-3].

Requirements:
- Primary focus: [category primary focus]
- Difficulty [X] means: [intensity description for this category]
- Avoid: [category avoid list]
- Format: { "text": "...", "difficulty": X }
- Must pass all common rules
- Should score 70+ on weighted evaluation

Example for "Generate 5 cards for Hot Topics at difficulty 3":
→ Primary focus: Moral challenge, debate potential
→ Difficulty 3 means: Highly divisive moral dilemmas
→ Output: Questions that will genuinely divide the room on ethics
```

## Common Grammar Fixes

| Error Pattern | Fix |
|--------------|-----|
| Missing question mark | Add `?` to all questions |
| "Whats" | "What's" |
| "tree" (as number) | "three" |
| "tought" | "thought" |
| "teache" | "teach" |
| "understod" | "understood" |
| "sonner" | "sooner" |
| "perpective" | "perspective" |
| "trings" | "things" |

## Quality Thresholds

| Weighted Score | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| 80+ | Excellent - Keep as is |
| 60-79 | Good - Minor revisions optional |
| 40-59 | Mediocre - Needs revision |
| Below 40 | Poor - Remove or completely rewrite |
